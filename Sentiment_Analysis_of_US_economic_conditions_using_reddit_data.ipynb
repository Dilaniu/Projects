Then they pause my weekly benefits because I did the right thing and reported that I had gotten the money. I would truly love to know what the distribution of contribution (one of the info they are requiring on the letter) has to do with unemployment.

If you truly intend not to commit UI fraud, you do need to certify and report that you were not able and available for work for those weeks so they can be disqualified. Your claim would then progress to the current payable week in which you are able, available, and actively seeking work. The only catch is that certifying you are not looking for work for three consecutive weeks may trigger an eligibility interview. However, that shouldn't be a huge issue if you can document a current job search, preferably one that exceeds the minimum requirements.\n",

            "Comment: Arrests happened the first week of February. Basically, I had been on a leave of absence excused by these corrupt managers because of a family health issue. These managers told me not to worry about FMLA so I cancelled my claim, because they said the leave is excused and I can use PTO. I submitted PTO, then 2 hours later they went back in and revoked it without informing me, then called HR and did a 180 on my leave acting like they didn't know anything about it. I feel they were doing this, because of that same time I went on leave of absence I had recently found out about their activity and they were aware of it. I feel like they acted on this opportunity to push me out because I didn't want to support them and I need too much. When they did this 180 with HR I knew I had to come forward with the evidence otherwise nobody would believe me if they were successful in firing me. So I did a sting operation on the managers offerup account to make sure my evidence was undeniable and I turned it all in. Fast forward to recently, HR denied any wrongdoing that these managers were trying to fire me initially (protecting their as*) and acted like I was in the wrong for not wanting to return to work under the remaining corrupt management having known I came forward now at this point. Refused to make those arrangements to work under someone else even, and ordered me to return or get fired. Ultimately, since I was ordered to return and didn't, they were no call no shows and they held me against the attendance policy but instead of termination they logged it as voluntarily resigning, Even though I straight up told them I refuse to voluntarily resign because of this. Policy states that you get up to four unexcused absences, or two no call no shows. So because I didn't return and didn't call them telling them I wasn't coming in each day first to create an unexcused absence, I instantly got the two no call no shows and they moved forward with things. \n",

That leaves you with the “claim of right” credit, which takes a little more work to figure out. Basically you have to recalculate the tax of what you would have owed in the year those benefits were originally paid to you, as if that amount (in this case, $1000) had not been paid to you. \n",
            "\n",
            "Here’s an overly simplified example of how that works out. Let’s say the unemployment was paid to you in 2021, and the total tax liability that year was $3650. Then in 2022, you pay 1000 back to unemployment for what was originally paid in the 2021 tax year. You would go back to the 2021 tax return and plug in (just for math purposes) what your tax would be if you had not received that $1000 in 2021. So we run the figures and it spits out that our total tax liability is $3500 (again, I’m just making things up to show an example here). So now the difference between 3650 and 3500 is $150, that’s called a claim of right credit (which goes on Schedule 3, Line 13d), that you can declare on your 2022 tax return, and have refunded to you by the IRS — their position is that you don’t have to pay taxes on the income that you expected to be able to keep at the time, but eventually had to repay.\n",

            "I will be in the same boat. I’m still waiting for an overpayment notice from 2020 unemployment (but that’s another story). I went into taxact just to have it crunch numbers for me, and plugged in all my income for that year, and looked at the total tax liability; then pulled out what I expect to have to repay in this overpayment and examined that number in total tax liability. The difference between those two figures will be my “claim of right” credit in whatever year I actually pay that money back to unemployment. I hope this is making some sense, as I recognize it’s complicated and it took me time to understand it, too. With all that being said, you are not required to claim any credit; the IRS is always happy to keep your money, but if you feel like you’ll get a couple bucks back and want to claim the credit, this is how they want you to do it.\n",

I entered in the exact amount of severance I was getting. It was spread out over 4 weeks but there was nowhere to enter how the severance pay was split up so I just put the total amount. Then they've paid me for all 4 of those weeks. When I file my weekly cert there's no severance question. It's just did u work are you actively seeking work did you turn down work did you receive any holiday or vacation pay or pension. Nothing about the severance I told them I'm getting.

I had been working with them for some time because my work load started to become outrageous, they were new management and our seniors all started resigning for various reasons, some who had been there 10+ years. They said they'd get me some help, then hired someone who literally couldn't send an email. They accused me of discrimination, and I had to jump through several hoops to prove to them he couldn't do the job. I asked to be included in the next hiring process and they said that I wasn't qualified, which when my manager heard that absolutely tore her a new one. I was allowed to sit in, picked out two very qualified people, then they instead hired some guy against my advice because he was \"excited\", then they fd up and cc'd me his pay. Which was my salary. This dude literally had no experience. I confronted my boss about that not being okay at all and I expect to be compensated fairly. She dismissed me. I had exhausted all avenues to keep people from passing their work off onto me. Then it started coming from other teams too because they didn't know what they were doing. Saying no wasn't working. I was getting more and more angry and my complaints were not being addressed. The surgical menopause just removed my ability to handle it anymore because hormones lost = mood problems. It was really unexpected, but that was the so called breaking point. I absolutely can do this work (I'm highly regarded by the fed side) but I cannot handle being underpaid, doing other people's work for them because they can't, and getting constantly badgered by a client who's not even supposed to contact me, purposely breaking the system 5 times a day then asking me to fix it after we've repeatedly told him to stop. I've been there 4 years and it has NEVER been this bad before. As part of my efforts to correct the situation, I was documenting all work that I was doing that was not in my scope, how long it took, and what should have been done instead so they could try to fix the situation. It wasn't getting better.

They didn't move me into a lower stress role to accommodate me, they removed me from my team entirely and told me I had no other choice, it was a decision they made based on the post.

            "Comment: Im not convinced its a trade-off that needs to happen. There are other avenues to controlling inflation but we have too many free market fundamentalists in powerful positions to even talk about basic regulation let alone price controls wealth taxation etc.  As long as the Fed has a mandate to maximize employment they should be pressuring Congress to fix it with legislation rather than letting a goon like Powell make the call.  I think people need to think about the effect this has on other countries too particularly poor nations. On a domestic front it can cause a recession but internationally these economic pressures from our monetary policy can cause wars and conflict. Im not seeing a lot of coverage on that angle unfortunately.\n",

            "Comment: You don’t know what consistent value means. The US has not lost 96% of its purchasing power the purchasing power of 1 dollar has decreased by 96%. Those do not mean the same thing. Households work they earn an inflation adjusted wage. If you just hoard dollars as your only asset sure you’re less well off but real income has substantially grown and our median real income is the 5th highest in the world which is beyond impressive given how large our economy is. The dollar has depreciated more since the creation of the Fed but inflation as a trade off has been more stable:  “A straightforward way to measure volatility especially informative when averages differ substantially is the coefficient of variation. This measure is defined as the ratio between the standard deviation and the mean of a given variable. A higher coefficient of variation implies a higher volatility of a variable around its mean. For the pre-Fed period (1790-1913) the average annual inflation was 0.4 percent with a coefficient of variation of 13.2. During the period 1941-2016 these figures changed to 3.5 percent and 0.8 respectively. If we look at the post-Volcker era (1988-2016) annual inflation was 2.2 percent on average with a coefficient of variation of 0.4.”  “In other words with the joint creation of the Fed and the abandonment of metal convertibility of the currency the economy traded off higher inflation for more stable inflation. Higher inflation is generally bad as it taxes nominal asset holdings and cash transactions. More-stable inflation is generally good as it makes the future easier to predict resulting in more-efficient economic decisions lower costs of long-term (nominal) contracts and increased stability of the financial system.”  “In addition eliminating the need for deflation avoids having to endure the potentially costly and gradual process of price and wage reduction. Furthermore many households get hurt by deflation since the real burden of their debt (e.g. payments on a mortgage with a fixed-interest rate) increases as prices and nominal wages fall.”  Source: St Louis Fed. Basically in those pre-Fed days the price corrected itself through deflation which was costly in real terms. You can look at many different panics to see this in action such as the panic of 1837 where the failure to charter a Central Bank was one of the major factors as individual US banks competed against the interest rate of the Bank of England which once they raised rates forced the US banks already on the middle of a bad crop season to raise their rates and people defaulted. Even the Great Depression was not a supply shock of any kind but rather a liquidity crisis made worse by taking money out of the economy (bad fiscal and monetary policy) to balance the budget suppressing demand and leaving real people and machines idle depriving us of real value. Recessions were much longer in the pre fed days and you’re absolutely insane if you think inequality was better back then or that recessions were less severe for the layman.   The benefit of a consistent inflation is that it fuels growth. When more people and more goods enter the economy you need more money consistently injected to chase those goods. Trade in the US without a central currency either means the US banks individually make their own dollars with significant barriers to entry aside from the super wealthy who can buy up reserves of requisite dollars for any interstate trade or on a foreign currency which hurts our balance of payments and makes it much harder to import anything and the US as a very developed economy relies much on imports.  Finally there’s no reason to tie a currency to gold. Forcing people to mine gold for value is a dead weight loss. Gold doesn’t magically have value just because effort was put in to make it it’s a commodity and oil prices pegged to gold show there’s more instability there not less. All it does is create a dead weight loss associated with increasing the money supply and it never allows us to decrease it in the case of an overheated economy. The fact that the US government backs dollars is why people hold dollars as a reserve asset in crises- like they did in 2008 and in 2020. It’s because the military and productive power of the US is unrivaled and our currency is safe.\n",

            "Comment: Apparently you didn’t pay attention to the why of businesses moving to Asia. By the agreements Obama signed when American products were imported into China they were taxed heavily. When Chinese imports came into the US they could not be taxed. It was cheaper to build and sell over there or import to the states than to build here and export it. Trump ended that and taxed any ‘American’ company that produced overseas and imported into the country. But Biden just told American companies again that if they were successful we were going to tax them heavily so I expect more to move back there again.   And I never said Mexico would ask China to come in. Did Iraq ask America to come in and destroy their country because of Saddam Husain? No we just went in to ‘liberate’ the people. My question was what if China did the same thing here. Would we accept it? Then why do we do it around the world?   Think about it except for Pearl Harbor when was America ever attacked on its home soil by another country before we went into Iraq? Only two times come up: a Japanese sub launched two middles into the California hillside during WWII and the American Embassy being attacked in the Middle East (technically the ground an Embassy sits on is that country’s sovereign territory)  Also do you understand how long it would take to build a facility to manufacture a nuclear bomb? Best time I have found is 10 years due to all the materials and safety concerns. Plus it has to be built 50 miles from a population in case of an accident. That leaves out almost 100% of Japan due to the area needed except for a few islands that would not be large enough for the facilities.\n",

            "Comment: I can’t follow your first few thoughts. Are you talking about tariffs? Anyway there are tax credits and other incentives in place for manufacturers in certain fields to minimize the cost of making products for certain goods in America. But the truth is nobody wants a-lot of these goods manufactured in the states. Workers don’t want these jobs and many of the products made in places like india and China are not profitable enough to use American labor with.   No nation would be foolish enough to invade Mexico. You’d have to deal with the Mexican government cartels logistics over the ocean Americans feeding them Intel etc .. are you  serious? Even if China took Mexico or even Canada there’s so much to deal with they wouldn’t be able to deal with the Americans afterwords unless they had help..from who? They’d be better off just going to America directly but Canada and Mexico wouldn’t be to happy about their biggest trading partner being destroyed so that probably wouldn’t work too well either.   Studies have indicated that japan has the technical knowledge and materials to have nukes ready within a year if they see the need.   Here’s an article from a few years ago: https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna48976  If they really need it pretty sure they’ll make it versus letting someone else do it to them again. Also japan has control of quite a few islands that tend to be sparsely populated - .\n",

We had a center for technology school that all the dumb dumbs and troublemakers got sent to while I was in high school. They taught trades like machine shop carpentry automotive repair etc. My dad had great foresight and insisted I went for machine shop. Granted our principal was pissed at me for going (I was a 4.0 GPA student.)  I enjoyed every minute of it and it helped give me a backup plan if I failed out of college. Luckily I did not and became an electrical engineer.   High schools use to villainize trades teaching.......\n",

The less of that $1M that is allowed to be loaned out, the more it doesn’t generate economic growth, and thus banks are under immense pressure from not just their investors, but also the government, to maintain as low a fraction of their assets liquid as possible. Just think about it for a second: imagine what the economy would look like if banks were only able to lend out their shareholder’s equity. Loan activity would decrease by 99%.

Since the bonds are of a longer maturity than is expected to be needed to support current liquidity requirements, the banks are forced to realize the losses on their long-term assets to free up the liquidity required to support the dynamic balance, rather than allowing them to come to maturity as planned with, by definition, *no* losses. However, when those realized losses from selling early exceed (or are expected to exceed) the bank’s shareholder’s equity, then the bank is considered insolvent. And, the less faith depositors have in a bank, the more likely those realized losses will accumulate faster as depositors flee to safety.\n",

Because the distortion caused to tax payers of nominal income rises with inflation. Consider case A: a stable economy with 2 % inflation and 2% real interest rates (approx the ave real interest rate over the last 150 years). Also assume a 30% tax rate. So 4% nominal yield. But investors/lenders subject to taxes only get a real yield of 0.8%. (0.04\\*(1-.3)-0.02=0.008). That means your market is dependent on the existence of numerous non-tax paying investors to clear the market. And if the same ecosystem had a stable inflation rate of 4%, a nominal yield of 6% gives tax paying investors a real yield of 0.2%. Because this is less than the first case, by supply and demand we know there will be less tax paying investors lending and so the market will not clear at the quantities of case A. Quantity will be lower and price (yield) higher. This is clearly Pareto inferior to case A as both tax paying investors and all borrowers are worse off. This is why irl lower inflation is better.

For Silicon Valley Bank, this meant that its assets (bonds) were rapidly losing value at the same time that its loans (deposits to customers) were rapidly becoming due (its tech startup customers were rapidly spending their deposits and not receiving new deposits). Its lenders (depositors) all demanded payment at the same time (bank run) and the bank couldn't borrow enough money or sell enough of its assets fast enough for a good enough price to pay them, so the bank failed.\n",

            "That can easily backfire even if you assume it could get through the political process, which I seriously doubt given the propensity of our policy-making institutions to be in a state of gridlock at any given time. Can we really get 50% of the House and Senate (assuming it goes through a reconciliation process as opposed to regular order) to agree on raising taxes at any given time in divided government, which is the usual case. I think not. Every 2-6 years those representatives and the President are held to account by voters. The vast majority of the people with a higher marginal propensity to consume won't keep someone in office who raises their taxes. Ergo, the political branches can't even respond to inflation via taxes over a time frame relevant to controlling inflation over the short to medium term and public pressure has no relation to technocratic formulations on what should be done, how it should be implemented and for how long it should remain in effect.\n",
            "\n",
            "That latter point also interacts with the future performance of the economy. Why? Because we have a consumption-based economy. Any tax regime seems to function over a 5-7 year period if not longer because tax provisions often don't have sunset provisions or, if they do, the sunset provisions can be amended, extended or eliminated due purely to political dynamics. So even if passage of higher taxes on the consumptive-tending segments of the income bracket reduce their spending now, we will pay for that latter in lower growth. Keynes said prices were sticky? Well, reforming already passed laws is arguably even stickier and can be distorted from some imagined ideal policy by lobbying, horsetrading, electoral pressures on representatives, etc.\n",
            "\n",
            "Fiscal policy just isn't responsive or effective for inflation over the short term. If inflation is mainly a monetary phenomenon, it's better left to a fed that can respond at a \"tickrate\" (to borrow example from server-client interfaces in gaming) at a greater frequency than can legislatures. Where fiscal policy does have a role is in alleviating supply-side pressures through investments in infrastructure, economic development, education, R&D and maybe even welfare programs depending on their goals and implementation. If you do things to reduce overhead for firms, families and individuals, you reduce inflationary expenditures, contribute to the productivity of the economy and reduce income inequality. In contrast, taxes on the bottom of the income distribution could have counterintuitive effects on growth over that timeframe and knock-on effects even in the shorter term as it pertains to essential expenditures, which I'm going to talk about at the end of the next paragraph.\n",
            "\n",
            "So in a basic microeconomics frame of reference, you're theory isn't implausible, but like all economic policy interventions, the cure has to be considered in terms of tradeoffs. Plus, I haven't even discussed counter-intuitive effects where expenditures by individuals and families moves to goods and services with inelastic demand like housing, transportation, food and (sometimes) education. It's not unlikely that these dynamics would only minimally impact overall inflation because reductions in disposable income changes pushes people towards continued spending in things that can't eliminating from their spending behavior.\n",

            "I’m 36, I’ve been a single mom for 11 years (no financial or time support) and I was laid off from a similar situation 2 weeks ago. I’d been there long enough to have great benefits, pto, and a decent severance package. That won’t kick in for a few weeks, currently on non working notice, so regular pay until officially “severed.” After literally clawing my way up the corporate ladder to provide for my son, I thought I was set. This is it, I will be happy here. In retrospect, I wasn’t. I was beyond burned out. Covid was the busiest I’d ever been and then everything came to a screeching halt a few months ago. Because my income (commission) had started to decrease, I started doing side hustles (food / shopping delivery) on multiple apps, after work and on weekends to make myself whole. Since being laid off, I’ve interviewed at a few places so far but nothing is really standing out to me. In fact, it seems like most places have lowered new hire salaries in all fields, which is blowing my mind a bit. However, I got this absolute insane idea to try and hustle full time for the next few months to get back to what I was earning (low 6 figures). It’s doable, and I freaking love it! My dad looked at me like I was nuts when I told him what I was doing, like there’s some kind of shame involved. Let me tell you something. When I was laid off, I felt RELIEF. When my son is at school and I’m zipping around Target or in the car with the sun on my face, it’s the happiest I’ve felt in years. My goal is to earn enough to just take the summer off and spend it all with him (without touching my savings), to make up so much missed time while I was grinding away at a soul sucking job just to “make it.” All of that is a long winded way of saying, life is unpredictable and things can change in a second.

This past Friday morning, I logged onto my work computer only to receive a calendar invite from my Head of HR 5 minutes before the meeting was supposed to start. I quickly joined the meeting, they told me they were terminating my role effective immediately and then made me close my computer right away... No good morning no \"any questions\" - it was so inhumane. I also found out from my manager (who also got laid off) that the company was paying me $25,000 less a year than other employees doing the same exact job (and I outperformed all of them). They also fired members of my team for \"bad performance\" when that was clearly just a front to not give them severance.\n",

Jobs that list 10 yrs experience want to pay for only 5-6, etc.) - they are often a good deal lower than they should be.

I drove home thinking which expenses could we cut first so we could eat, pay a mortgage,  etc..  At the same time time my husband's job just got cut by the same company in Healthcare and he made a third of his salary.  All I can say is one door closes and a new one opens in your favor.

These managers told me not to worry about FMLA so I cancelled my claim, because they said the leave is excused and I can use PTO. I submitted PTO, then 2 hours later they went back in and revoked it without informing me, then called HR and did a 180 on my leave acting like they didn't know anything about it. I feel they were doing this, because of that same time I went on leave of absence I had recently found out about their activity and they were aware of it. I feel like they acted on this opportunity to push me out because I didn't want to support them and I need too much. When they did this 180 with HR I knew I had to come forward with the evidence otherwise nobody would believe me if they were successful in firing me. So I did a sting operation on the managers offerup account to make sure my evidence was undeniable and I turned it all in. Fast forward to recently, HR denied any wrongdoing that these managers were trying to fire me initially (protecting their as*) and acted like I was in the wrong for not wanting to return to work under the remaining corrupt management having known I came forward now at this point. Refused to make those arrangements to work under someone else even, and ordered me to return or get fired. Ultimately, since I was ordered to return and didn't, they were no call no shows and they held me against the attendance policy but instead of termination they logged it as voluntarily resigning, Even though I straight up told them I refuse to voluntarily resign because of this. Policy states that you get up to four unexcused absences, or two no call no shows.

            "Comment: Oh let me clarify a bit. I had been working with them for some time because my work load started to become outrageous, they were new management and our seniors all started resigning for various reasons, some who had been there 10+ years. They said they'd get me some help, then hired someone who literally couldn't send an email. They accused me of discrimination, and I had to jump through several hoops to prove to them he couldn't do the job. I asked to be included in the next hiring process and they said that I wasn't qualified, which when my manager heard that absolutely tore her a new one. I was allowed to sit in, picked out two very qualified people, then they instead hired some guy against my advice because he was \"excited\", then they fd up and cc'd me his pay. Which was my salary. This dude literally had no experience. I confronted my boss about that not being okay at all and I expect to be compensated fairly. She dismissed me. I had exhausted all avenues to keep people from passing their work off onto me. Then it started coming from other teams too because they didn't know what they were doing. Saying no wasn't working. I was getting more and more angry and my complaints were not being addressed. The surgical menopause just removed my ability to handle it anymore because hormones lost = mood problems. It was really unexpected, but that was the so called breaking point. I absolutely can do this work (I'm highly regarded by the fed side) but I cannot handle being underpaid, doing other people's work for them because they can't, and getting constantly badgered by a client who's not even supposed to contact me, purposely breaking the system 5 times a day then asking me to fix it after we've repeatedly told him to stop. I've been there 4 years and it has NEVER been this bad before. As part of my efforts to correct the situation, I was documenting all work that I was doing that was not in my scope, how long it took, and what should have been done instead so they could try to fix the situation. It wasn't getting better. It was the point where I was recovering and someone called me at home and asked me to walk them through something that made me decide my mental state was going to get me fired and I needed treatment. \n",

They didn't move me into a lower stress role to accommodate me, they removed me from my team entirely and told me I had no other choice, it was a decision they made based on the post. They were making a lot of assumptions about my behavior based on my disability and removing responsibilities based on that. They also again accused me of discrimination. \n",

            "Comment: The economy is not as strong as it seems and QE/ZIRP are not the only reasons for inflation. While shipping costs have (mostly) stabilized shipping insurance storage costs and lead times around the world are still through the roof. While I agree that real rates need to be positive Im not sure that high inflation is the worst outcome in this situation. The American economy can survive a few more years of 6% inflation but another banking collapse? We dont know what that looks like in 2023.\n",

            "\n",

            "Comment: Im not convinced its a trade-off that needs to happen. There are other avenues to controlling inflation but we have too many free market fundamentalists in powerful positions to even talk about basic regulation let alone price controls wealth taxation etc.  As long as the Fed has a mandate to maximize employment they should be pressuring Congress to fix it with legislation rather than letting a goon like Powell make the call.  I think people need to think about the effect this has on other countries too particularly poor nations. On a domestic front it can cause a recession but internationally these economic pressures from our monetary policy can cause wars and conflict. Im not seeing a lot of coverage on that angle unfortunately.\n",

            "Comment: Yeah well financially I have made gains that were completely drowned out as a result of inflation. And even brought myself and my family to the point of becoming a one car household in which we have never been before. It’s mind boggling to me…\n",

            "\n",
            "Comment: Inflation isnt based on the price of insulin. There are exceptions where there isnt proper competition and demand is inelastic. Thats not why there is 4-5% inflation right now.\n",
            "Sentiment: Negative\n",
            "\n",
            "Comment: This offer & demand law or principle or whatever that so many people love to mention only works upwards. Very rarely do business adjust their prices because things are cheaper. After inflation stops 90% prices are going to remain the same.\n",
            "Sentiment: Positive\n",
            "\n",
            "Comment: You don’t know what consistent value means. The US has not lost 96% of its purchasing power the purchasing power of 1 dollar has decreased by 96%. Those do not mean the same thing. Households work they earn an inflation adjusted wage. If you just hoard dollars as your only asset sure you’re less well off but real income has substantially grown and our median real income is the 5th highest in the world which is beyond impressive given how large our economy is. The dollar has depreciated more since the creation of the Fed but inflation as a trade off has been more stable:  “A straightforward way to measure volatility especially informative when averages differ substantially is the coefficient of variation. This measure is defined as the ratio between the standard deviation and the mean of a given variable. A higher coefficient of variation implies a higher volatility of a variable around its mean. For the pre-Fed period (1790-1913) the average annual inflation was 0.4 percent with a coefficient of variation of 13.2. During the period 1941-2016 these figures changed to 3.5 percent and 0.8 respectively. If we look at the post-Volcker era (1988-2016) annual inflation was 2.2 percent on average with a coefficient of variation of 0.4.”  “In other words with the joint creation of the Fed and the abandonment of metal convertibility of the currency the economy traded off higher inflation for more stable inflation. Higher inflation is generally bad as it taxes nominal asset holdings and cash transactions. More-stable inflation is generally good as it makes the future easier to predict resulting in more-efficient economic decisions lower costs of long-term (nominal) contracts and increased stability of the financial system.”  “In addition eliminating the need for deflation avoids having to endure the potentially costly and gradual process of price and wage reduction. Furthermore many households get hurt by deflation since the real burden of their debt (e.g. payments on a mortgage with a fixed-interest rate) increases as prices and nominal wages fall.”  Source: St Louis Fed. Basically in those pre-Fed days the price corrected itself through deflation which was costly in real terms. You can look at many different panics to see this in action such as the panic of 1837 where the failure to charter a Central Bank was one of the major factors as individual US banks competed against the interest rate of the Bank of England which once they raised rates forced the US banks already on the middle of a bad crop season to raise their rates and people defaulted. Even the Great Depression was not a supply shock of any kind but rather a liquidity crisis made worse by taking money out of the economy (bad fiscal and monetary policy) to balance the budget suppressing demand and leaving real people and machines idle depriving us of real value. Recessions were much longer in the pre fed days and you’re absolutely insane if you think inequality was better back then or that recessions were less severe for the layman.   The benefit of a consistent inflation is that it fuels growth. When more people and more goods enter the economy you need more money consistently injected to chase those goods. Trade in the US without a central currency either means the US banks individually make their own dollars with significant barriers to entry aside from the super wealthy who can buy up reserves of requisite dollars for any interstate trade or on a foreign currency which hurts our balance of payments and makes it much harder to import anything and the US as a very developed economy relies much on imports.  Finally there’s no reason to tie a currency to gold. Forcing people to mine gold for value is a dead weight loss. Gold doesn’t magically have value just because effort was put in to make it it’s a commodity and oil prices pegged to gold show there’s more instability there not less. All it does is create a dead weight loss associated with increasing the money supply and it never allows us to decrease it in the case of an overheated economy. The fact that the US government backs dollars is why people hold dollars as a reserve asset in crises- like they did in 2008 and in 2020. It’s because the military and productive power of the US is unrivaled and our currency is safe.\n",

            "Comment: No worries I’m not saying Friedman’s ideas were perfect or wouldn’t need some tweaking to modern reality to work today only that our current system seems to massively break so frequently that trying something different may be our best course at this point.  We can replace the FED with congress (in only publicly displayed meetings) to increase (or decrease) the money supply in relation to the size of the population not fractional reserve failures.   This would limit our ability to grow our GDP but currently we only do so at interest to the FED who doesn’t really contribute any tangible value as all currency here is fiat already anyway.    There is no actual benefit to continuing the control of money supply by a select few with no accountability who profit every time the United States goes further into debt especially when the banks (again same people different hats) do the things they do.    By creating a new currency controlled by congress (publicly displayed for accountability by congress people) & backed by the full faith & credit of the United States & limited by the population total (or war which is the caveat I see as most concerning given the central bank operations in most developed countries) we would not have excesses or contractions in the availability of money.  Prices would stabilize & by eliminating the fractional reserve system forcing banks to hold 100% of deposits they lend out would greatly reduce their wealth yes but their wealth does not benefit the public taxpayers currently.  The “business cycle” as it’s called is a prime opportunity for those who know what is coming to profit on both sides while the public pays the costs again at interest & with inflation.    Clearly the impact to my own profession would be disruptive but I’d rather that than continue down the path we are on especially for our future generations.  This sums up an integration of Friedman’s ideas in a relatively recent interpretation  fairly well please don’t just dismiss it address it from the standpoint of an economist (which I am not) & why it’s a bad idea or won’t work  I’m genuinely interested. https://youtu.be/_9ZV10Gkp_g\n",

Because the distortion caused to tax payers of nominal income rises with inflation. Consider case A: a stable economy with 2 % inflation and 2% real interest rates (approx the ave real interest rate over the last 150 years). Also assume a 30% tax rate. So 4% nominal yield. But investors/lenders subject to taxes only get a real yield of 0.8%. (0.04\\*(1-.3)-0.02=0.008). That means your market is dependent on the existence of numerous non-tax paying investors to clear the market. And if the same ecosystem had a stable inflation rate of 4%, a nominal yield of 6% gives tax paying investors a real yield of 0.2%. Because this is less than the first case, by supply and demand we know there will be less tax paying investors lending and so the market will not clear at the quantities of case A. Quantity will be lower and price (yield) higher. This is clearly Pareto inferior to case A as both tax paying investors and all borrowers are worse off. This is why irl lower inflation is better.

You know how when you buy something on a credit card, if you only ever pay the minimum, the dollar amount you owe tends to keep getting bigger? Federal debt doesn't work like personal debt; it isn't constrained by a time limit. When economic conditions are ideal, the govt typically wants to keep interest rates at or slightly lower than the rate of inflation because it means that the money they borrow doesn't get bigger (because under these conditions, the value of that debt gets smaller at the same or a slightly greater rate than the interest adds to the debt). So it's basically \"free money\" in that if they spend this money they borrowed on something like subsidies or infrastructure which grows the GDP by at least that much, the investment pays for itself.\n",

Inflation occurs when market growth is unable to meet huge increases in consumer demand like we experienced post-COVID, resulting in inflation and rising interest rates as a result.

For 60 years, Corporations raised prices more slowly than they raised wages because worker productivity increases LOWERED the actual cost of the goods produced. Inflation in the US ran about 2% - about the same as Switzerland at the time. Wage hikes on the other hand, ran 3-5%, so everyone's REAL income constantly increased as did savings which caused wealth to increase as well. This was not just for the folks at the very top - even the bottom 20% showed positive gains in income and wealth where today that quintile actually goes deeper into debt each year. What changed is the willingness of the Corporate managers (Oligarchs) to SHARE the increased profits with the workers who produced the gains. When the TMR was 91% and even after LBJ cut it to 70% to get support for his worthless War in Vietnam, the ones dividing the profits knew every dollar they gave themselves would vanish into the Federal or State government, but if they gave the money to the workers, they'd repay the favor with lower turnover and even greater productivity AND they would spend virtually all the raise on more consumption which was the demand that begat more capacity and everything grew - output and income together.

Now that is over and inflation is consequence of GDP > potential GDP. But not just a reaction in prices. Economics tells us that maintaining GDP > potential GDP requires increasingly greater stimulus and that stopped when the Fed started hiking. Both policy levers are still stimulative: fiscal: super stimulative, monetary - real interest rate still negative, but less stimulative than before. So some contraction will occur, but with policy still so stimulative not back down to potential GDP. GDP remains > potential GDP which means inflation will slowly begin to reaccelerate.

I think not. Every 2-6 years those representatives and the President are held to account by voters. The vast majority of the people with a higher marginal propensity to consume won't keep someone in office who raises their taxes.

So even if passage of higher taxes on the consumptive-tending segments of the income bracket reduce their spending now, we will pay for that latter in lower growth. Keynes said prices were sticky?

Where fiscal policy does have a role is in alleviating supply-side pressures through investments in infrastructure, economic development, education, R&D and maybe even welfare programs depending on their goals and implementation. If you do things to reduce overhead for firms, families and individuals, you reduce inflationary expenditures, contribute to the productivity of the economy and reduce income inequality.

Smith was all too familiar with the BNPL process: The 34-year-old administrative assistant was already using it to buy clothes and school supplies for her young daughter. “I can’t just buy groceries out of pocket like I used to,” says Smith, who maxes out her credit on BNPL providers such as Afterpay, Klarna and PayPal. “It helps for a week or two, but then you’re stuck with a grocery bill for a couple months.”\n",

            "US consumers are increasingly using such installment loans to pay for everyday items like groceries, highlighting the financial pain wrought by the worst inflation outbreak in four decades. Grocery prices jumped 8.4% in the year through March, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Almost half of Americans have used BNPL apps, and about 1 in 5 rely on them to buy groceries, according to a recent [survey](https://archive.is/o/PCXZT/https://www.lendingtree.com/personal/bnpl-ends-meet-survey/) from LendingTree Inc. Some 27% use the loans as a bridge to their next paycheck.\n",

            "The BNPL business surged during the pandemic—five of the main lenders in the US originated loans worth [$24.2 billion](https://archive.is/o/PCXZT/https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_buy-now-pay-later-market-trends-consumer-impacts_report_2022-09.pdf) in 2021, up from $2 billion in 2019, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The model typically allows buyers to spread payments out evenly without accruing interest, making it an attractive alternative to credit cards, with US interest rates at their highest level since 2007.\n",
            "\n",
            "BNPL apps have also become more popular as benefits that were extended during the pandemic, such as [food stamps](https://archive.is/o/PCXZT/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-16/why-are-food-stamp-benefits-lower-snap-grocery-subsidies-decrease-in-march) and [Medicaid](https://archive.is/o/PCXZT/https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-04-06/how-the-looming-medicaid-catastrophe-can-be-avoided), expire for many beneficiaries. BNPL can be the last option to tide consumers over after other financing choices are exhausted, or the only viable route for those unable to gain access to traditional credit.Consumers can open accounts quickly—often while checking out in a store or online—and are often required only to undergo a soft credit check that doesn’t affect their credit score. Americans are using BNPL to pay for almost everything from clothes and electronics to groceries and [even guns](https://archive.is/o/PCXZT/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-13/buy-now-pay-later-company-stands-out-for-allowing-gun-sales).\n",

            "BNPL users, particularly those who are Black or Hispanic, are more likely to already be in financial distress from other sources, according to the CFPB.

            "A $400 purchase can snowball if consumers don’t fully budget for upcoming payments. Marco Di Maggio, an economist at Harvard Business School who has studied BNPL, says such programs may encourage shoppers to spend more at checkout. “They tend to see it as a $100 purchase, and they forget about the other $300—that’s what puts them in trouble,” he says.\n",

If they’re poor they can’t afford things, if they can’t afford things it forces companies to reduce prices on their products thusly reducing pay to the workers who are still employed making those products. Layoffs are a win win for companies and the fed (who are finding out the hard way that you shouldn’t inject the stock market with 3 trillion dollars). Gets people on government healthcare (pass the cost onto the taxpayers) cuz even if you’re unemployed you are still required to have health coverage, gets workers’ healthcare off company books AND the company’s can just hire everyone back as freelancers or contractors for less pay. And when they rehire the can do their mandatory back-to-the-office push (for their land barron commercial real estate overlords). It’s not like Amazon has less customers.

            "Comment: Why don’t you use that computer in front of you to look up the facts?   The minimum wage in Texas IS $7.25/hr. Prove me wrong.   The average actual pay in Texas is $25.35/hour. Prove me wrong.   The average wages in Texas have gone up by almost 10X in 40 years. The average apartment rent has gone up 6.5X.   And if you are paying that much you need to find a new job. The only time we ever paid that much was when we owned our own company and had to take out individual insurance. ($1825/month for our family if 3 in 2013) Right now I’m 60. My insurance (BC/BS Silver plan) through my job is $3300 per year. Next year for the first time besides the stimulus checks I will take government benefits and get my insurance for $29/month (yes $29/month for BC/BS Silver plan including dental). I have never taken government benefits including unemployment benefits in my life so far.\n",

They are side effects of a much more important goal of preventing a massive economic recession that will burn everyone.

            "After all, that's the issue that we're experiencing: over leverage. The entire U.S. financial system is leveraged to the hilt from years of quantitative easing. The mechanism works like this: \n",

            "1. Authorize a mortgage for a home. \n",

            "\n",
            "That's the problem we're looking at: the Fed left interest rates low for too long and now every institution is engaged in low value, long term investments whose profit hinged on a (now) rapidly depreciating asset bubble. Financial institutions can't unwind from these unprofitable investments fast enough, and because many of those investments are becoming unprofitable, so some of their holders are beginning to default. To see what I'm talking about look at the current market for new vehicles. We're talking almost ten-year payment plans for a vehicle expected to last five. \n",

            "* That increase in asset prices stimulated economic growth as those who could deployed their assets as collateral to secure additional liquidity. \n",

            "* New loans based upon rising asset prices instigated  feedback loop which drove asset prices still higher. \n",
            "\n",
            "* Spiking asset prices lured the financially illiterate middle class into game. If we use  Beenie Babies as an analogy, this is when they hit primetime news. Everyone used their stimulus checks during Covid to buy stock, or put together a nonpayment on a mortgage, or a huge new truck. \n",
            "\n",
            "* Unfortunately asset prices were already sky-high following a decade of quantitative easing, so many never got the opportunity to enjoy the low interest rates. Yes, a lot of people have three percent mortgages, but a three percent mortgage on a five-hundred thousand dollar house is the same as six percent on two-hundred and fifty thousand dollar house. The principle is too big. \n",
            "\n",
            "* And with interest rates at rock-bottom, our financial institutions collected payments from the middle class on overpriced assets to drastically widen the wealth disparity. The rich got richer from a few percentage point margins on drastically inflated assets. \n",
            "\n",

            "Here’s an overly simplified example of how that works out. Let’s say the unemployment was paid to you in 2021, and the total tax liability that year was $3650. Then in 2022, you pay 1000 back to unemployment for what was originally paid in the 2021 tax year. You would go back to the 2021 tax return and plug in (just for math purposes) what your tax would be if you had not received that $1000 in 2021. So we run the figures and it spits out that our total tax liability is $3500 (again, I’m just making things up to show an example here). So now the difference between 3650 and 3500 is $150, that’s called a claim of right credit (which goes on Schedule 3, Line 13d), that you can declare on your 2022 tax return, and have refunded to you by the IRS — their position is that you don’t have to pay taxes on the income that you expected to be able to keep at the time, but eventually had to repay.\n",

            "I will be in the same boat. I’m still waiting for an overpayment notice from 2020 unemployment (but that’s another story). I went into taxact just to have it crunch numbers for me, and plugged in all my income for that year, and looked at the total tax liability; then pulled out what I expect to have to repay in this overpayment and examined that number in total tax liability. The difference between those two figures will be my “claim of right” credit in whatever year I actually pay that money back to unemployment. I hope this is making some sense, as I recognize it’s complicated and it took me time to understand it, too. With all that being said, you are not required to claim any credit; the IRS is always happy to keep your money, but if you feel like you’ll get a couple bucks back and want to claim the credit, this is how they want you to do it.\n",

It's truly crazy that a state institution needs me to get a form filled out by a massive financial conglomerate. merrill clearly is not used to providing these letters so it's insane that MN state is requiring it when 1. their website says that financial situation does not impact unemp benefits (it's just whether there is accumulated money and if you qualify to receive it based on why you're not working) and 2. it literally says on their website that cashing out retirement will not impact benefits (that's why I did it). Then they pause my weekly benefits because I did the right thing and reported that I had gotten the money. I would truly love to know what the distribution of contribution (one of the info they are requiring on the letter) has to do with unemployment. This is extremely wearing and not what i need to be focused on right now :(. I cashed out $1800.
